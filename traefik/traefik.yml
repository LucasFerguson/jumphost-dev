# /opt/traefik/traefik.yml
# This is Traefik's STATIC config (install config).
# It defines entrypoints, providers, logging, and the dashboard.

api:
  dashboard: true
  insecure: false
  # Insecure means the dashboard is open on :8080 with no auth.
  # Fine for early testing; however, lock this down later.

entryPoints:
  web:
    address: ":80"
    # HTTP traffic for your websites and dashboards.

  minecraft:
    address: ":25565"
    # Minecraft Java uses raw TCP on 25565.

  bedrock:
    address: ":19132/udp"
    # Minecraft Bedrock uses UDP on 19132.

  traefik:
    address: ":8080"
    # Traefik dashboard/API when api.insecure=true.

providers:
  file:
    directory: "/etc/traefik/dynamic"
    watch: true
    # watch=true means you can edit dynamic YAML and Traefik reloads without restart.

log:
  level: DEBUG
  # DEBUG mode: very chatty, great while building.
  # Later you can drop to INFO.

accessLog:
  # Access logs show traffic info. For TCP/UDP this is more limited than HTTP,
  # but it is still useful to confirm connections are hitting the right entrypoint.
